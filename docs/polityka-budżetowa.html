<p>O ile neoklasycy i neokeynesiści koncentrują się na podażowych ograniczeniach wzrostu gospodarczego, o tyle postkeynesiści i zwolennicy Nowoczesnej Teorii Monetarnej przyjmują przeciwną postawę.
Uważają, że we współczesnych gospodarkach wzrost jest ograniczany wielkością całkowitego popytu a bariery związane z ogólną podażą np.
pracy nie są istotne (Skott 2018).
Wynika to jednak, w przeciwieństwie do dwóch pierwszych szkół ekonomicznych, z faktu, iż przedmiotem analizy postkeynesowskiej są gospodarki doświadczające trwałego bezrobocia czyli praktycznie wszystkie współcześnie istniejące.
Nie oznacza to oczywiście, że w teorii postkeynesowskiej i MMT coś takiego jak ograniczenia podażowe nie istnieje.
Ponieważ jednak występują one rzadko i są przejściowe, to nie stanowią ważnego elementu badań w przeciwieństwie do neoklasyków i neokeynesistów.
Propozycje dotyczące polityki budżetowej przedstawiane przez MMT stanowią kontynuację wizji stworzonej przez Abbę Lernera (Lerner 1943)<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;polskie tłumaczenie, używane dalej w tekście (Lerner 2015).
A.
Lerner inspirował się z kolei na pracy A.G.
Knappa, której doskonałe omówienie znajduje się w pracy Knakiewicz (1984)&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>26</sup></a> pod nazwą finanse funkcjonalne.
Wynika to z takiego samego rozumienia roli państwa w tworzeniu pieniądza (L. Randall Wray 2018).
Idea, że państwo w swoich wydatkach nie jest ograniczone przez wysokość ściąganych podatków jest bezpośrednim pokłosiem modelu gospodarki wojennej realizowanego przez takie kraje jak Wielka Brytania i USA.
Mimo niespotykanej skali wydatków wojennych udało się utrzymać inflację w ryzach.
Było to możliwe m.in.
dzięki emisji tzw.
obligacji wojennych, których głównym celem było “zamrożenie” nadmiernego popytu w sytuacji, gdy większość produkcji była skierowana nie na potrzeby konsumpcji a na cele wojenne (Levey, 2019).</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Cele polityki budżetowej według MMT<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cele-polityki-bud%C5%BCetowej-wed%C5%82ug-mmt"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Lerner (2015, s. 126) uważał, iż</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>jedynym punktem odniesienia polityki fiskalnej państwa – podatków i wydatków, zaciągania pożyczek i ich spłaty, wreszcie emisji przez państwo pieniądza i ściągania go z rynku – powinny być wyniki tych działań dla gospodarki, nie zaś jakakolwiek tradycyjnie uznana doktryna tego, co jest dla gospodarki zdrowe, a co zdrowe nie jest.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wychodząc z tego założenia sformułował on dwa prawa finansów funkcjonalnych:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<em>„Podstawowym obszarem finansowej odpowiedzialności państwa (jako że nikt inny nie może jej przejąć) jest utrzymanie całkowitych wydatków na dobra i usługi w kraju na poziomie nie większym ani nie mniejszych niż taki, przy którym po aktualnych cenach mogą zostać wykupione wszystkie możliwe do wyprodukowania produkty. Jeśli pozwoli się, aby całkowite wydatki przewyższyły ten poziom, pojawi się inflacja; jeśli z kolei całkowite wydatki spadną poniżej tego poziomu, wystąpi bezrobocie.„</em> Dlatego gdy popyt jest zbyt wysoki państwo powinno zmniejszyć wydatki i podnieść podatki, a gdy popyt jest niedostateczny to powinno zwiększyć swoje wydatki i obniżyć podatki.</li>
<li><em>„<span class="math display">\[R\]</span>ząd powinien pożyczać pieniądze jedynie wówczas, gdy pożądane jest, aby obywatele posiadali mniej pieniędzy, a więcej obligacji rządowych <span class="math display">\[...\]</span>. A pożądane może to być w sytuacji, gdy bez tego zabiegu stopy procentowe byłyby zbyt niskie <span class="math display">\[...\]</span>.”</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Do tak sformułowanych dwóch celów polityki fiskalnej (likwidacja bezrobocia i inflacji) należy dodać trzeci, sformułowany na samym początku cytowanego artykułu: eliminacja gospodarczej niepewności.
Naturalnie nie chodzi tu o całkowitą likwidację powyższych zjawisk ale działania w celu ich maksymalnego ograniczania.
MMT zwraca dodatkowo uwagę na bardzo ważne uzależnienie stosowalności powyższych praw od posługiwania się własną walutą przez gospodarki.</p>
<p>Jak widać, niejako wbrew swojej nazwie, głównym podmiotem polityki ekonomicznej państwa Nowoczesna Teoria Monetarna czyni ministerstwo finansów a nie bank centralny.
Nawet do kontrolowania inflacji zaleca używanie instrumentów fiskalnych.</p>
<p>Takie sformułowanie celów polityki fiskalnej nie było jednak niczym szczególnie kontrowersyjnym w okresie „New Deal” w USA i czasach powojennych. Nawet M. Friedman (1948) uważał, iż rząd powinien równoważyć budżet tylko w sytuacji osiągnięcia pełnego zatrudnienia. Większość ówczesnych rządów krajów tzw. „pierwszego świata” stawiało sobie za cel szybki rozwój gospodarczy przy maksymalnym zatrudnieniu opierając się na teorii Keynesa, a co za tym idzie posługując się głównie polityką budżetową.
Dopiero kryzys naftowy i okres stagflacji rozpoczęty kryzysem naftowym w 1973 r.
doprowadził do zmiany paradygmatu polityki ekonomicznej.</p>
<p>Ze słabości podejścia polegającego na dyskrecjonalnym sterowaniu ogólnym popytem zdał sobie sprawę nawet twórca finansów funkcjonalnych Abba Lerner (L. Randall Wray 2018).
Do najbardziej znanych problemów związanych z wdrażaniem finansów funkcjonalnych należą te będące konsekwencją upływu czasu, jaki zajmuje podjęcie kolejnych decyzji politycznych czyli: a) rozpoznanie konieczności podjęcia decyzji, b) podjęcie decyzji o kształcie, formie i warunkach zastosowania instrumentu fiskalnego oraz c) czasu potrzebnego gospodarce na reakcję na podjęte działania (Friedman 1966; za Mitchell, Wray, i Watts 2019, s. 341) .
Oznacza to, iż podjęcie decyzji może zająć tyle czasu, że przyjęte działania zamiast efektu antycyklicznego będą cykl dodatkowo wzmacniać i działać inflacyjnie.
Inną, powszechnie znaną wadą dyskrecjonalnej polityki fiskalnej jest destabilizujący efekt zerojedynkowego działania typu stop/go – rząd zwiększa wydatki aby stymulować popyt a następnie ścina wydatki gdy pojawia się inflacja.
Z problemów tych zdawano sobie naturalnie sprawę.
Nie udało się znaleźć jednak ich skutecznego rozwiązania.</p>
<p>Postkeynesowska krytyka prób ogólnego podnoszenia popytu nie ograniczała się jednak tylko do powyższych zastrzeżeń.
H.
Minsky, twórca teorii kryzysów finansowych (Kąsek i Lubiński 2010; Nawrot 2009; Minsky 2008), który wywarł ogromny wpływ na twórców MMT, swoją krytykę wywodzi częściowo z pozycji instytucjonalnych<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;promotorem jego pracy doktorskiej był J.
Schumpeter.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>27</sup></a>.
Ewolucja poglądów na finanse funkcjonalne, wynikająca ze zmian instytucjonalnych, których był świadkiem przez przeszło 50 lat, doprowadziła go do następujących wniosków (L. Randall Wray 2018):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>ogólne zwiększanie całkowitego popytu zwiększyłoby niestabilność finansową oraz wywołałoby kryzysy kredytowe (<em>credit crunches</em>) poprzez stymulowanie wydatków prywatnych, z których część byłaby finansowana długiem;</p></li>
<li><p>wywołałoby też inflację, gdyż płace i ceny wzrosłyby w sektorach wysoko zaawansowanych zanim zostałaby wygenerowana wystarczająca podaż miejsc pracy w sektorach opóźnionych;</p></li>
<li><p>taka polityka nie zmniejszyłaby nierówności a nawet mogłaby doprowadzić do ich zwiększenia (zwiększając relatywne dochody w sektorach rozwiniętych);</p></li>
<li><p>stan pełnego zatrudnienia doprowadziłby do zbyt dużych inwestycji wywołanych nadmiernym optymizmem a to wywołałoby inflację, która dodatkowo zwiększyłaby nierówności<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;ponieważ podwyżki płac nie nadążają za wzrostem cen to ich realna wartość spada co powoduje wzrost zysków firm.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>28</sup></a>;</p></li>
<li><p>rosnąca część dochodu narodowego pochodząca z odsetek od długu publicznego trafiałaby do zagranicznych posiadaczy, osób o wysokich dochodach, sektora finansowego, nieruchomościowego i ubezpieczeniowego (<em>FIRE – finance, insurance, real estate</em>) a przez to byłaby „marnowana” czyli nie zwiększałaby ani popytu ani podaży produkcji krajowej;</p></li>
<li><p>rosnący strumień odsetek od długu publicznego może znacznie ograniczyć możliwości walki z inflacją gdyż wymagane będzie wtedy znacznie większe zmniejszenie wydatków lub podniesienie podatków;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Z powyższych uwag wynika nie wprost, że po pierwsze, rosnący strumień odsetek wspomniany w punkcie 6 prawdopodobnie zwiększyłby oczekiwania inflacyjne, a po drugie przy bardzo dużym długu publicznym w celu utrzymania stabilizacji gospodarczej i walki z inflacją państwo może zostać zmuszone do ogłoszenia „bankructwa” czyli przestać spłacać dług paradoksalnie nie dlatego, że nie jest go w stanie spłacać (bo jako emitent waluty zawsze jest w stanie) ale dlatego że traci kontrolę nad wydatkami publicznymi i polityką budżetową. Należy również zauważyć, że punkt 5 również wskazuje na wzrost nierówności społecznych. Autorzy związani z nurtem MMT zwracają również uwagę na to, że konsekwencją stymulowania ogólnego popytu w celu osiągnięcia poziomu pełnego zatrudnienia, może być osiągnięcie stanu podobnego do NAIRU – z wyżej wymienionych powodów bariera inflacji pojawi się zanim zostanie osiągnięty stan pełnego zatrudnienia (Tcherneva 2008, s. 30). Nie oznacza to oczywiście, że H. Minsky a za nim MMT są zwolennikami zrównoważonego budżetu. Proponowanym przez MMT rozwiązaniem tych problemów jest propozycja gwarancji zatrudnienia omówiona w kolejnym rozdziale.</p>

</h2>
<p>W kwestii założeń polityki budżetowej Nowoczesna Teoria Monetarna jest głęboko zakorzeniona w teorii post-keynesowskiej i swoje teoretyczne założenia wywodzi od takich ekonomistów jak M.
Kalecki i J.M.
Keynes.
Oznacza to, że jest w wielu miejscach sprzeczna z teorią neoklasyczną.
Już w 1934 r.
M.
Kalecki wykazał, „że inwestycje „wymuszają” oszczędności, których wartość równa się wartości tych inwestycji” (Kalecki 1979, s. 267).
Oznacza to, że inwestycje publiczne nie tylko nie wymagają i nie „zabierają” oszczędności prywatnych ale je tworzą. Jak wykazano w rozdziale drugim banki komercyjne nie są ograniczone w kreowaniu kredytu ani przez depozyty ani przez rezerwy. Jeśli ten wniosek uzupełni się o fakt, że wydatki publiczne działają w kierunku obniżenia stóp procentowych kreując dodatkowe depozyty to oznacza, że według MMT nie tylko nie występuje efekt wypychania (<em>crowding out</em>) opisywany w literaturze neoklasycznej, ale mamy do czynienia ze zjawiskiem przyciągania (<em>crowding in</em>) inwestycji prywatnych zwłaszcza w fazie recesji (Mitchell, Wray, i Watts 2019, s. 337). Wzmacnia to rolę polityki fiskalnej. Kolejnym ważnym założeniem przesądzającym o tak istotnej roli jaką odgrywa polityka fiskalna w MMT jest wielkość mnożnika wydatków państwowych większa od jedności. Badania przeprowadzone w Polsce (Łaski, Osiatyński, i Zięba 2010; Lawędziak 2017) pokazały, że mnożnik ten w latach 2006-2013 wahał się w przedziale 1,59-1,7 dla danych odsezonowanych i nie odbiegał znacznie od wartości dla USA, Niemiec i Francji gdzie mieścił się w przedziale 1,5-1,6. Mnożnik ten dodatkowo rośnie, jeśli uwzględni się sektor finansowy (Makrelov i in. 2019). Zmniejszenie ryzyka bankructwa, wzrost wartości aktywów oraz poprawa oczekiwań spowodowane zwiększonymi wydatkami publicznymi zmniejsza ograniczenia kredytowe co dodatkowo stymuluje inwestycje i wzrost. Analiza jedenastu krajów strefy euro jest zgodna z powyższymi wynikami (Levrero, Deleidi, i Iafrate 2019). Mnożnik inwestycji publicznych w latach 1970-2016 był powyżej jedności i wzrósł dodatkowo po kryzysie z 2008 r.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Deficyt budżetowy i dług publiczny<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#deficyt-bud%C5%BCetowy-i-d%C5%82ug-publiczny"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Nowoczesna Teoria Monetarna podkreśla, że dług publiczny w praktyce nie jest żadnym długiem a bardziej przypomina mniej płynną, za to dającą dochody odsetkowe formą pieniądza emitowaną przez ministerstwo finansów (Kelton 2020).
Jego emisja służy głównie do kontroli płynności w sektorze bankowym, a co za tym idzie stóp procentowych.
W połączeniu z teorią finansów funkcjonalnych oznacza to, że z punktu widzenia MMT wielkość deficytu i długu publicznego ma drugorzędne znaczenie.
Rząd równie dobrze może osiągać nadwyżki (gdy konieczne jest zmniejszenie inflacji) jak i znaczne deficyty w sytuacji spowolnienia gospodarczego lub kryzysów.
Zagrożenie inflacją pojawia się dopiero gdy gospodarka zbliża się do maksimum swoich możliwości produkcyjnych.
Jak się okazuje w praktyce, w Polsce bariera ta jest dość odległa.
Naturalny eksperyment, jakim jest napływ funduszy unijnych sięgający nawet przeszło 3% PKB spowodował proporcjonalny wzrost wydatków budżetowych.
Ten ogromny strumień pieniędzy, który trafił do gospodarki w żaden sposób nie wpłynął jednak na wzrost inflacji (rys. <a href="polityka-bud%C5%BCetowa.html#fig:rys30">4.1</a>).</p>

<p>Jednakże w Polsce wysokość deficytu oraz długu publicznego jest znacznie ograniczony.
Polska, oprócz Węgier, prawdopodobnie jedyny kraj na świecie posiada konstytucyjne ograniczenie wysokości długu publicznego<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Art. 216.
pkt 5.
Nie wolno zaciągać pożyczek lub udzielać gwarancji i poręczeń finansowych, w następstwie których państwowy dług publiczny przekroczy 3/5 wartości rocznego produktu krajowego brutto.
Sposób obliczania wartości rocznego produktu krajowego brutto oraz państwowego długu publicznego określa ustawa.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>29</sup></a>.
Dodatkowo, będąc członkiem Unii Europejskiej podlega zapisom traktatowym.
Traktat o Funkcjonowaniu Unii Europejskiej w artykule 126 następująco reguluje kwestie deficytu budżetowego:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Państwa Członkowskie unikają nadmiernego deficytu budżetowego.</em></li>
<li><em>Komisja nadzoruje rozwój sytuacji budżetowej i wysokość długu publicznego w Państwach Członkowskich w celu wykrycia oczywistych błędów. Bada ona poszanowanie dyscypliny budżetowej na podstawie poniższych dwóch kryteriów:</em></li>
</ol>
<!-- --><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>
<p><em>czy stosunek między planowanym lub rzeczywistym deficytem publicznym a produktem krajowym brutto przekracza wartość odniesienia, chyba że:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>stosunek ten zmniejszył się znacznie oraz w sposób stały i osiągnął poziom bliski wartości odniesienia,</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>lub przekroczenie wartości odniesienia ma charakter wyjątkowy oraz tymczasowy i stosunek ten pozostaje bliski wartości odniesienia;</em></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- --><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><em>czy stosunek między długiem publicznym a produktem krajowym brutto przekracza wartość odniesienia, chyba że stosunek ten zmniejsza się dostatecznie i zbliża się do wartości odniesienia w zadowalającym tempie. Wartości odniesienia są sprecyzowane w Protokole w sprawie procedury dotyczącej nadmiernego deficytu, który jest załączony do Traktatów.</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Odpowiednie zapisy w <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/PL/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12008M/PRO/12&amp;from=EN">wymienionym Protokole</a> brzmią następująco:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wartości odniesienia określone w artykule 126 ustęp 2 Traktatu o funkcjonowaniu Unii Europejskiej są następujące:</em></p>
<p><em>- 3 % dla stosunku planowanego lub rzeczywistego deficytu publicznego do produktu krajowego brutto wyrażonego w cenach rynkowych,</em></p>
<p><em>- 60 % dla stosunku zadłużenia publicznego do produktu krajowego brutto wyrażonego w cenach rynkowych.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Takie zapisy zawarte w najważniejszych dokumentach prawnych Unii Europejskiej i Polski sugerują, że wdrożenie rozwiązań proponowanych przez MMT jest praktycznie niemożliwe, przynajmniej w najbliższych czasach, a teoria ta pozostanie tylko teorią.
Jednak działania podjęte przez kraje europejskie oraz instytucje UE w reakcji na pandemię koronawirusa pokazują, że nie jest to prawda.
Nawet w obecnym systemie prawnym, tak restrykcyjnym w tym względzie jak polski, legalne znacznie zwiększenie deficytu i długu publicznego jest możliwe.
W 2020 roku w celu przeciwdziałania skutkom pandemii wykorzystano do tego instytucję kontrolowaną przez państwo ale nie zaliczaną do sektora instytucji państwowych czyli Państwowy Fundusz Rozwoju S.A (PFR)<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;lista jednostek sektora instytucji rządowych i samorządowych dostępna jest &lt;a href="https://stat.gov.pl/obszary-tematyczne/rachunki-narodowe/statystyka-sektora-instytucji-rzadowych-i-samorzadowych/lista-jednostek-sektora-instytucji-rzadowych-i-samorzadowych-s-13-zgodnie-z-esa2010-stan-na-31-grudnia-2017-r-,6,8.html"&gt;pod tym adresem&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>30</sup></a>.
Emitowane przez ten podmiot obligacje nie zwiększają <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/finanse/zadluzenie-sektora-finansow-publicznych">państwowego długu publicznego</a> obliczanego na potrzeby określenia przekroczenia limitu konstytucyjnego.
Wartość tzw.
Tarczy Finansowej oferowanej przez PFR <a href="https://pfr.pl/tarcza.html">wynosi ponad 60 mld zł</a>, co stanowi ok. 3% polskiego PKB.
Jest to możliwe, gdyż zgodnie z ustawą o finansach publicznych, to minister finansów określa zasady obliczania długu publicznego (Marchewka-Bartkowiak 2013).
Jednak metodologia Eurostatu nie pozwala na takie zabiegi i dług wykreowany w ten sposób zalicza się do wskaźnika długu publicznego a co za tym idzie stanowi podstawę do weryfikacji w ramach procedury nadmiernego deficytu.
Jednak zapisy traktatowe są bardziej elastyczne niż zapis w polskiej konstytucji.
Zgodnie ze wspomnianym traktatem (art. 126):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>9. Jeśli Państwo Członkowskie w dalszym ciągu nie realizuje zalecenia Rady, może ona wezwać dane Państwo Członkowskie do przyjęcia w wyznaczonym terminie środków zmierzających do takiego ograniczenia deficytu, jakie zostanie uznane przez Radę za niezbędne do zaradzenia sytuacji.</em></p>
<p><em>11. Tak długo jak Państwo Członkowskie nie stosuje się do decyzji przyjętej na podstawie ustępu 9, Rada może zadecydować o zastosowaniu lub, w odpowiednim przypadku, o wzmocnieniu jednego lub kilku z następujących środków: - zażądać od danego Państwa Członkowskiego, aby opublikowało dodatkowe informacje, które określi Rada, przed emisją obligacji i papierów wartościowych, - wezwać Europejski Bank Inwestycyjny do ponownego rozważenia polityki udzielania pożyczek wobec danego Państwa Członkowskiego,</em></p>
<p><em>- zażądać złożenia w Unii przez dane Państwo Członkowskie nieoprocentowanego depozytu o stosowanej wysokości aż do czasu, gdy, w ocenie Rady, nadmierny deficyt zostanie skorygowany,</em></p>
<p><em>- nałożyć grzywnę w stosownej wysokości.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Należy ponadto zauważyć, że Rada głosuje większością kwalifikowaną, co oznacza, że gdyby 14 krajów członkowskich również postanowiło wdrożyć rozwiązania proponowane przez MMT lub tylko dopuścić je w jednym kraju jako „poligonie doświadczalnym” to można by dokonać takiej zmiany polityki budżetowej unikając kary. Niemniej, nawet biorąc pod uwagę fakt, iż UE przy obliczaniu deficytu bierze pod uwagę fazę cyklu koniunkturalnego (European Commission i Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs 2019, s. 8), należy uznać, że obecnie próba wdrożenia polityki budżetowej proponowanej przez Nowoczesną Teorię Monetarną byłaby sprzeczna z prawem Unii Europejskiej. Konsekwencji nie da się obecnie przewidzieć gdyż po pierwsze Rada dysponuje wachlarzem środków dyscyplinujących, pod drugie nie wiadomo jak w średnim i dłuższym okresie kształtowałby się deficyt i dług w stosunku do PKB i po trzecie instytucje europejskie bardzo różnie podchodzą do kwestii łamania prawa w zależności od typu sprawy oraz kraju członkowskiego.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Podatki<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#podatki"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Jak już wspomniano, według MMT podatki są siłą napędową pieniądza.
To konieczność płacenia podatków kreuje popyt na pieniądz tworzony przez państwo.
Celem systemu monetarnego (z punktu widzenia emitenta waluty) jest przesunięcie niektórych zasobów do sektora publicznego; celem podatków z kolei jest wykreowanie popytu na walutę, którą wykorzystuje się do osiągnięcia tego głównego celu.
Zatem pieniądz został wykreowany, by umożliwić rządowi dysponowanie zasobami, które wytworzyło społeczeństwo (Larry Randall Wray 2019, s. 214).
Jeśli państwo nie będzie w stanie wyegzekwować i zgromadzić podatków, nie spotka się z wystarczającą skłonnością do akceptacji jego waluty krajowej przy sprzedaży dokonywanej na jego rzecz.
Oznacza to, że podatki muszą być płacone powszechnie.
Zaskakujący jest więc prawie całkowity brak prac przestawiających poglądy MMT na temat optymalnej struktury systemu podatkowego.
Kwestie te zostały chyba najszerzej opisane w popularno-naukowej książce „Nowoczesna teoria monetarna MMT: wprowadzenie do makroekonomii suwerennych systemów monetarnych” (Larry Randall Wray 2019) oraz w artykule tego samego autora o równie mało naukowym charakterze (L. Randall Wray 1993). Przedstawione w niej cechy systemu podatkowego można ująć w dwóch kategoriach, „ilościowej” i „jakościowej”. Podział taki wynika z faktu, iż strona dochodowa budżetu czyli podatki nie jest bezpośrednio związana ze stroną wydatkową. Od strony ilościowej podatki mają spełniać funkcję „legitymizacji” pieniądza emitowanego przez państwo.
W tym celu muszą być pobierane w takiej wysokości aby zapewnić wystarczający popyt na pieniądze, którymi państwo płaci za świadczone na jego rzecz usługi i wykorzystywane przez nie produkty.
Autorzy ze szkoły MMT nie przedstawiają jednak żadnych propozycji minimalnej, koniecznej do zebrania, kwoty w stosunku do planowanych wydatków.
Można jedynie przypuszczać, że jest to zależność nieliniowa i związana z poziomem rozwoju gospodarczego, stopniem „monetyzacji” gospodarki, struktury instytucjonalnej, zdolności państwa do ściągania podatków oraz poziomu zaufania do instytucji państwa. Wydaje się, że MMT zakłada, iż w krajach wysokorozwiniętych nie istnieje bariera popytu na walutę krajową. Nie jest to kontrowersyjne założenie w przypadku Stanów Zjednoczonych, krajów członkowskich UE czy Japonii. W przypadku wielu innych krajów warunek ten nie musi być jednak spełniony, czego autorzy piszący w nurcie MMT wydają się być świadomi. Istnieje szeroka literatura dotycząca dolaryzacji lub euroizacji gospodarek państw. Z badań wynika (Rochon i Seccareccia 2003; Drenik i Perez 2020; Özyurt i Economics) 2020; Tweneboah, Gatsi, i Asamoah 2019), że wzrost popytu na walutę obcą jest związany głównie z wysoka inflacją i wysoką zmiennością kursu waluty krajowej. W Polsce również dość niedawno funkcjonował drugi obieg dolarowy.</p>
<p>Opierając się na danych Międzynarodowego Funduszu Walutowego można sprawdzić, czy istnieje związek między ilością pieniądza w wybranych gospodarkach a dochodami podatkowymi. Odrzucając dyktatury takie jak Mjanma (gdzie za posiadanie walut obcych może grozić więzienie) czy będące w stanie wojny jak Afganistan minimalny poziom można szacować na 11% PKB czyli taki jak w przypadku Ugandy. Jednak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugandan_shilling">Wikipedia sugeruje</a>, że nie jest to dobry przykład ponieważ dolar amerykański jest tam w powszechnym użyciu. Dlatego bezpieczniej uznać, że jest to raczej ok. 13% tak jak w Egipcie, który wyróżnia się poza tym wysokim użyciem pieniądza (rys. <a href="polityka-bud%C5%BCetowa.html#fig:rys301">4.2</a>)</p>

<p>Oznacza to, że w sytuacji stabilnej inflacji i stabilnego kursu walutowego wystarczy, że podatki będą generować popyt na walutę krajową nie większy niż 13% PKB aby waluta ta była w powszechnym użyciu.</p>
<p>Od strony jakościowej rozważania w ramach MMT dotyczą optymalnej struktury podatkowej.
Skoro podatki nie służą finansowaniu wydatków, to logika tego co i w jakim stopniu powinno być opodatkowane, jest zupełnie inna niż obecnie funkcjonująca.
Znika, uważana za najważniejszą (Mazurek-Chwiejczak 2016), fiskalna funkcja podatków i związane z nią wymagania odnośnie efektywnego sposobu finansowania wydatków budżetowych.
W takim paradygmacie istnieje znacznie większa swoboda kształtowania systemu podatkowego.
Według Larry Randall Wray (2019) głównym kryterium nakładania podatków powinna być realizacja celów społecznych w tym wpływanie na zachowania podmiotów gospodarczych – zniechęcanie do niepożądanych społecznie zachowań i zachęcanie do działań pożądanych.
W takim ujęciu redystrybucyjna funkcja podatków traci swój sens, choć ograniczanie najwyższych dochodów pozostaje jednym z celów nakładania podatków według MMT.
Jest to jednak uzasadniane koniecznością powiązania wysokości dochodów z wykonywaną pracą a nie z koniecznością sfinansowania transferów socjalnych.
Wynika z tego, że nie należy opodatkowywać rzeczy i czynności uznanych za pozytywne, na przykład pracy<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Podatki od innych dochodów np.
finansowych są za to wskazane.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>31</sup></a>.
Przy takim podejściu nie do uniknięcia są oczywiście dyskusje czy potencjalny przedmiot opodatkowania jest pozytywny czy negatywny dla społeczeństwa oraz gdzie jest granica, za którą działanie negatywne przeważa nad pozytywnym<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Jak pisał Paracelsus „&lt;em&gt;Cóż jest trucizną? Wszystko jest trucizną i nic nie jest trucizną. Tylko dawka czyni, że dana substancja nie jest trucizną”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>32</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>Dobrym przykładem podatku, który pokazuje konsekwencje różnicy w podejściu do podatków między MMT a obecnie obowiązującym paradygmatem jest podatek od powierzchni (lub objętości) domu.
Posiada on obie wymagane przez MMT cechy: byłby podatkiem powszechnym oraz zwiększałby koszt działań społecznie negatywnych.
Jak pisze Larry Randall Wray (2019, s. 219) „Dlaczego zachowaniem niepożądanym miałoby być mieszkanie w domu?
Chodzi o wpływ na środowisko: o przygotowanie ziemi, materiałów budowlanych, umeblowanie i – co najważniejsze – o energię, którą wykorzystujemy do ogrzewania i chłodzenia naszych domów”. Brzeziński (2017, s. 177) dodaje, iż opodatkowanie nieruchomości usprawiedliwia fakt ponoszenia wydatków na infrastrukturę obsługującą te nieruchomości oraz stanowi w pewnej mierze odpłatność za zajęcie na cele prywatne przestrzeni publicznej. Jak widać nie jest to jednak inna nazwa dla istniejącego w wielu krajach podatku katastralnego gdyż podstawą opodatkowania jest wielkość domu a nie jego nominalna wartość. Wartość ta ma znacznie większy związek z lokalizacją nieruchomości a nie jej szkodliwością społeczną i ekologiczną. Co więcej, podatek od wartości nieruchomości zachęca do przenoszenia się z dala od centrów miast a co za tym idzie podnosi koszty społeczne związane z rozlewaniem się miast.</p>
<p>Istotną zaletą podatków majątkowych jest stosunkowo duża przewidywalność możliwych do osiągnięcia za ich pomocą wpływów podatkowych, które to wpływy są w zasadzie niezależne od zmian koniunktury gospodarczej (Brzeziński 2017).
Pisał już o tym M. Kalecki w 1943 r. (Kalecki 1979, s. 339-349):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>„Gdy utrzymuje się pełne zatrudnienie za pomocą wydatków państwowych finansowanych z pożyczek, to dług publiczny będzie stale rosnąć. Nie musi to jednak prowadzić do żadnych zaburzeń rozmiarów produkcji i zatrudnienia, jeśli odsetki od długu finansuje się za pomocą rocznego podatku majątkowego. Po opłaceniu podatku majątkowego bieżący dochód jednych kapitalistów będzie niższy, a innych – wyższy niż w przypadku, gdyby dług publiczny się nie zwiększył. Niemniej ich łączne dochody pozostaną niezmienione, a ich zagregowana konsumpcja zapewne też znacznie się nie zmniejszy. Dalej, podatek majątkowy nie wpłynie na skłonność do inwestowania w kapitał trwały, gdyż podatek ten płaci się od każdego rodzaju majątku.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Larry Randall Wray (2019, s. 221) wyróżnia trzy rodzaje niepożądanych podatków: podatki od wynagrodzeń, podatki konsumpcyjne oraz podatki dochodowe od osób prawnych. Uzasadnienie ich likwidacji jest jednak pobieżne i pomija wiele ważnych aspektów.</p>
<p>W przypadku podatku od wynagrodzeń trafnie zauważa, iż promuje on dochody uzyskiwane z innych źródeł niż praca przez co zwiększa nierówności. Jednak podnoszone przez niego zarzuty takie jak preferowanie zastępowanie ludzi maszynami, obniżanie konkurencyjności międzynarodowej spowodowane wyższymi kosztami pracy są sprzeczne z proponowaną zasadą opodatkowania rzeczy niekorzystnych społecznie. Z punktu widzenia społeczeństwa podnoszenie wydajności pracy jest korzystne, a strategia zdobywania przewagi konkurencyjnej poprzez obniżanie kosztów pracy jest niekorzystna.
Podatek ten z kolei posiada ważne zalety z punktu widzenia MMT gdyż jest jednym z najbardziej powszechnych oraz istotnie wpływa na ograniczenie popytu. W artykule (L. Randall Wray 1993) pojawia się lepszy argument za co najmniej pogłębioną analizą podatku PIT a mianowicie fakt, iż będąc kosztem dla pracodawcy zostaje przerzucony przynajmniej częściowo na ceny produktów i usług i w ten sposób jest potencjalnie inflacjogenny<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Potencjał ten zależy od możliwości kształtowania marży przez firmy, a ta z kolei od stopnia monopolizacji (Kalecki 1980).&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>33</sup></a>. Argument ten jest prawdziwy również dla pozostałych dwóch podatków.</p>
<p>Nieprzekonująca jest również argumentacja za zniesieniem podatku od konsumpcji, który jest nawet bardziej powszechny niż dochodowy i jeszcze skuteczniej obniża popyt nie wpływając negatywnie na inflację. Słuszna jest uwaga, że jest to podatek silnie degresywny (wraz ze wzrostem dochodów spada udział wydatków konsumpcyjnych na rzecz oszczędności) jednak realnie istniejące systemy podatków konsumpcyjnych (podatek VAT) posiadają zwykle kilka stawek w tym stawkę zerową a poprzez swoją powszechność pozwalają na takie korzystne z punktu widzenia ekologii i zdrowia działania jak podnoszenie cen mięsa w stosunku do żywności pochodzenia roślinnego. Oczywiście można VAT zastąpić szeregiem indywidualnych podatków o charakterze akcyzowym ale koszty administracyjne takiej zmiany mogły by być znaczne a korzyści ekonomiczne bardzo wątpliwe.</p>
<p>Najwięcej kontrowersji wzbudza jednak postulat likwidacji podatku dochodowego od osób prawnych (CIT). Rzeczywiście jego podstawową wadą jest konstrukcja zachęcająca do zaciągania długu (tzw. „tarcza podatkowa”). Sprzyja również generowaniu niepotrzebnych kosztów, które mogą być odpisane od podatku. Likwidacja tego podatku rozwiązałaby również problem rajów podatkowych. Podatek ten ma również charakter degresywny - dużym podmiotom łatwiej wynegocjować jego obniżenie lub likwidację a także łatwiej przenieść jego ciężar na klientów. Niemniej zaproponowana alternatywa w postaci zwiększonego opodatkowania właścicieli firm jest nierealna w dzisiejszym świecie. Likwidacja podatku CIT oznaczałaby, że wzrośnie dochód do dyspozycji firm. Część tego dochodu zostaje w firmie na potrzeby inwestycyjne a reszta jest wypłacana właścicielom np.
w formie dywidendy. Obecnie sposobem na uniknięcie lub obniżenie zobowiązania CIT stosowanym przez korporacje jest wykazywanie dochodów w krajach o bardzo niskiej lub zerowej stawce tego podatku przy jednoczesnym generowaniu kosztów w krajach o wysokim podatku. Pozwala to zarówno na uniknięcie płacenia podatku CIT, jak i wykazywania dochodów z własności kapitału w podatkach PIT. Proponowana przez MMT likwidacja CIT tylko uprości ten proceder unikania opodatkowania bo raje podatkowe dalej będą umożliwiać uniknięcie płacenia podatków przez właścicieli firm.</p>
<p>Ciekawą propozycją o daleko idących skutkach, jest postulat MMT ukształtowania takiej struktury dochodów aby podatki nie musiały być wykorzystywane w celu redukcji nierówności. Inaczej mówiąc szkoła ta preferuje metody zmniejszające nierówności w dochodach przed opodatkowaniem a nie po.</p>
<p>Ujmując kwestie opodatkowania z innej strony można uznać, że według MMT sekwencja ustalania optymalnej struktury podatkowej wygląda następująco:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Wprowadzanie podatków powszechnych mające na celu wykreowanie dostatecznego popytu na pieniądz centralny.</li>
<li>Wprowadzenie podatków od dochodów niezwiązanych z pracą w celu ograniczenia „wycieku” wydatków publicznych na oszczędności.</li>
<li>Wprowadzenie podatków zmniejszających konsumpcję w celu przeciwdziałania inflacji.</li>
</ol>
<p>Podział taki pokrywa się z grubsza z podziałem podatków odpowiednio na majątkowe, dochodowe i konsumpcyjne.</p>
<p>W Polsce największym źródłem dochodów budżetowych jest podatek konsumpcyjny czyli podatek od towarów i usług VAT, kolejny dużo mniejszy udział ma podatek akcyzowy.
Na trzecim miejscu jest podatek dochodowy od osób fizycznych PIT i od osób prawnych CIT.
Pozostałe podatki, w tym podatek od niektórych instytucji finansowych (zwany popularnie podatkiem bankowym), podatek od gier czy podatek od nieruchomości stanowią razem mniej niż połowę tego ostatniego.</p>

<p>Przed analizą struktury podatków w Polsce z punktu widzenia MMT i zaproponowaniem wersji bardziej zgodnej z tą szkołą należy rozwinąć kwestię różnicy między podatkiem VAT i akcyzą oraz uzupełnić powyższy obraz o dwa podatki: od nieruchomości oraz od dochodów kapitałowych.</p>

</h3>
<p>Jak wspomniano, przedstawiciele szkoły MMT reprezentowani przez L.
Randalla Wray’a są zwolennikami podatku akcyzowego oraz przeciwnikami podatku od konsumpcji jakim jest VAT.
Jak się jednak bliżej przyjrzeć obu tym daninom, to okazuje się, że istnieje między nimi dużo podobieństw.
Największy wpływ na oba te podatki w Polsce odgrywa prawodawstwo Unii Europejskiej ponieważ oba podlegają częściowej harmonizacji w ramach tego ugrupowania.
Akcyza jest podatkiem selektywnym, nakładanym na pewne rodzaje towarów, nie podlegają mu w ogóle usługi.
Akcyzę można uznać za podatek uzupełniający w stosunku do podatku od towarów i usług (Wolański 2016, str. 180).
Podatkiem tym objęte są wyroby akcyzowe czyli produkty energetyczne takie jak paliwa czy węgiel, energia elektryczna, alkohol i napoje alkoholowe oraz wyroby tytoniowe oraz samochody osobowe (Ustawa z dnia 6 grudnia 2008 r. o podatku akcyzowym z póz. zm. 2008).</p>

<p>Porównanie przedstawione w tabeli <a href="polityka-bud%C5%BCetowa.html#tab:tab31">4.1</a> pokazuje, iż należy zgodzić się z poglądem o komplementarności tych dwóch rodzajów podatków. Podczas gdy podatek akcyzowy zapewnia znacznie większą swobodę w kształtowaniu wysokości opodatkowania wybranych dóbr to podatek VAT obejmuje znacznie szerszą bazę podatkową przez co znacznie lepiej nadaje się do ograniczania nadmiernego popytu. Ogólność podatku od towarów i usług powoduje również, że łatwiej nim manipulować a nawet niewielki zmiany mają duży wpływ na całkowity popyt. Funkcjonowanie wielu jego stawek powoduje, że może on mieć również wpływ na kształtowanie struktury konsumpcji jednak nie tak selektywny jak podatek akcyzowy. Można więc chyba przyjąć, że w Polsce i w Unii Europejskiej, w przeciwieństwie do USA, optymalnym rozwiązaniem z punktu widzenia MMT jest miks obu podatków z większą rolą podatku akcyzowego niż obecnie. Pełniłyby on funkcje dodatkowego, wysokiego progu podatkowego od dóbr luksusowych lub uznanych za wyjątkowo niekorzystne społecznie. Taka zmiana zwiększyłaby również skuteczność systemu podatkowego jako automatycznego stabilizatora koniunktury. Wraz ze wzrostem dochodów rośnie właśnie konsumpcja dóbr luksusowych.
Zwiększenie roli automatycznych stabilizatorów jest jednym z ważniejszych postulatów MMT. Łatwość nabywania towarów w innych krajach UE, zwłaszcza dla osób zamożnych, wymagała by jednak większej harmonizacji podatku akcyzowego w UE.</p>

<p>Podatek od nieruchomości uregulowany jest w ustawie z dnia 12 stycznia 1991 r.
o podatkach i opłatach lokalnych (tekst jedn.: Dz. U. z 2014 r. poz. 849 z późn. zm.).
Jest podatkiem zasilającym dochody gmin, dotyczy wszelkich nieruchomości, bez względu na charakter prawny właściciela nieruchomości.
Przedmiotem opodatkowania podlegają budynki, budowle i grunty.
Podstawa opodatkowania w podatku od nieruchomości nie jest definiowana jako wartość rynkowa nieruchomości czy gruntów.
Brane są pod uwagę znamiona zewnętrzne, takie jak powierzchnia i wartość amortyzacyjna (Wolański 2016, s. 240).</p>

Rysunek 4.4: Udział podatku od nieruchomości w dochodach gmin<br> Źródło: Opracowanie własne na podstawie Banku Danych Lokalnych GUS
</p>
</div>
<p>Tak marginalna rola tego podatku wynika głównie z faktu jego bardzo niskiej stopy opodatkowania w przypadku budynków mieszkalnych.
W 2021 r.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Stawki tego podatku są waloryzowane corocznie w oparciu o inflację.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a>
maksymalna stawka podatku od nieruchomości w przypadku budynków mieszkalnych wyniosła 0,85 zł od 1 m2 powierzchni użytkowej a w przypadku budynków związanych z prowadzeniem działalności gospodarczej 24,84 zł od 1 m2 powierzchni użytkowej.
Oznacza to, że podatek od mieszkania o powierzchni 100 m2 wyniósł maksymalnie<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Gminy mają możliwość stosowania niższych stawek podatku.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>35</sup></a> 85 zł rocznie a podatek od zakładu usługowego o takiej samej powierzchni 2 484 zł rocznie
. Oznacza to, że w przypadku mieszkań i budynków mieszkalnych stawka podatku jest obecnie symboliczna i istnieje w Polsce instytucjonalna przestrzeń do znacznego zwiększenia roli tego podatku, zwłaszcza przy jednoczesnym obniżeniu podatku dochodowego
.</p>
<p>Należy jeszcze zauważyć, że przyznanie podatkowi od nieruchomości tak istotnej roli jest możliwe właśnie przy założeniu, że celem państwa jest dążenie do pełnego zatrudnienia oraz że państwo ma realne narzędzia osiągnięcia tego stanu.
W przeciwnym przypadku wzrost opodatkowania podatkiem od nieruchomości wymagałby systemu zwolnień z uwagi na fakt, iż obejmuje on także osoby bez dochodów umożliwiających jego opłacanie.
W sytuacji występującego przymusowego bezrobocia podatek od nieruchomości nie może być rozpatrywany jako substytut podatku od dochodów.</p>

</h3>
<p>Podatek od osób fizycznych w Polsce obejmuje, oprócz dochodów z pracy, również dochody od kapitału.
Są one opodatkowane ryczałtowo stawką 19% (pozostałe dochody do kwoty 85 528 zł rocznie są opodatkowane stawką 18% a powyżej tej kwoty stawką 32%) i dotyczą dochodów uzyskanych między innymi z:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>odsetek</p></li>
<li><p>dywidend</p></li>
<li><p>dochodu z tytułu udziału w funduszach kapitałowych</p></li>
<li>
<p>z odpłatnego zbycia:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>papierów wartościowych,</p></li>
<li><p>pożyczonych papierów wartościowych (sprzedaż krótka),</p></li>
<li><p>pochodnych instrumentów finansowych oraz realizacji praw z nich wynikających,</p></li>
<li><p>udziałów w spółkach,</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Z powodu stosunkowo niskiej stawki oraz słabo rozwiniętego rynku kapitałowego w Polsce podatek ten odgrywa dość niewielką rolę (rys. <a href="polityka-bud%C5%BCetowa.html#fig:rys32">4.5</a>).
Coraz mniej podatników osiąga dochody z tego tytułu, choć ci, którzy tego dokonali osiągają coraz większe zyski.</p>

<p>Trzeba jednak zauważyć, że powyższy obraz jest niepełny.
Dzięki funkcjonującej w UE swobodzie przepływu osób i kapitału, osoby uzyskujące wysokie dochody z kapitału mogą stosunkowo łatwo przenieść swoją siedzibę podatkową do jednego z wielu funkcjonujących w UE rajów podatkowych np.
Luksemburga, Monako czy Lichtensteinu<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Przykłady rajów podatkowych w UE: &lt;a href="https://financialsecrecyindex.com/en/introduction/fsi-2018-results" class="uri"&gt;https://financialsecrecyindex.com/en/introduction/fsi-2018-results&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://missingprofits.world/" class="uri"&gt;https://missingprofits.world/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>36</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Rozwijając jednak zagadnienie podatku od osób fizycznych to oprócz tego, że stanowi on czwarte najważniejsze źródło dochodów publicznych to istotny jest fakt, że mimo dwóch stawek jest to w rzeczywistości podatek liniowy.
Liczba podatników w wyższym przedziale podatkowym nie sięga 4% (rys. <a href="polityka-bud%C5%BCetowa.html#fig:rys33">4.6</a>).
Przeszło dwukrotny wzrost tej liczby wynika częściowo z efektu inflacji czyli nominalnego a nie realnego wzrostu płac.</p>

<p>Liniowy charakter podatku dochodowego w Polsce jest sprzeczny z generalnym postulatem MMT zalecającym wprowadzanie automatycznych stabilizatorów koniunktury wyrażonym najbardziej bezpośrednio w uzasadnieniu sztandarowej propozycji tej szkoły czyli gwarancji zatrudnienia<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Ciekawym sposobem na rozwiązanie dylematu czy zlikwidować PIT czy utrzymać jego progresywną wersję jest postulat znacznego zwiększenia kwoty wolnej od podatku.
Szerzej na temat ekonomicznych skutków takiego rozwiązania (Augustyński 2016)&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>37</sup></a>.
Otóż mimo swoich wad wypunktowanych przez L.
Randay’a Wray’a w cytowanej książce, podatek ten posiada istotną przewagę nad podatkami konsumpcyjnymi i majątkowymi.
W przeciwieństwie do tych pierwszych powoduje zmniejszenie oszczędności, które stanowią „dziurę” osłabiającą skuteczność polityki fiskalnej. W stosunku do tych drugich przewaga polega na tym, że progresywny podatek dochodowy jest pozytywnie wrażliwy na inflację. Progresja powoduje, że inflacja skutkuje przenoszeniem podatników do wyższych progów podatkowych. Oznacza to, że w wyniku wyższej inflacji następuje automatyczny wzrost przeciętnego opodatkowania co hamuje tendencje inflacyjne. Efekt ten jednak maleje wraz ze wzrostem zamożności społeczeństwa i spadającym udziałem konsumpcji w wydatkach gospodarstw domowych. W tym sensie spełnia warunek idealnego podatku wg MMT (Mitchell, Wray, i Watts 2019, s. 323).</p>

</h2>
<p>Konstytucja RP doskonale pokazuje jak pełny sprzeczności jest system gospodarczy w Polsce.
Z jednej strony jest Art. 65.
pkt 5, który stwierdza iż „Władze publiczne prowadzą politykę zmierzającą do pełnego, produktywnego zatrudnienia poprzez realizowanie programów zwalczania bezrobocia, w tym organizowanie i wspieranie poradnictwa i szkolenia zawodowego oraz robót publicznych i prac interwencyjnych.” Bez żadnych zmian może być on podstawą do wdrażania jednej z podstawowych propozycji MMT czyli systemu gwarancji zatrudnienia.</p>
<p>Z drugiej strony jednak są w konstytucji zawarte takie artykuły jak: ·</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Art. 216.
pkt 5.
Nie wolno zaciągać pożyczek lub udzielać gwarancji i poręczeń finansowych, w następstwie których państwowy dług publiczny przekroczy 3/5 wartości rocznego produktu krajowego brutto.
Sposób obliczania wartości rocznego produktu krajowego brutto oraz państwowego długu publicznego określa ustawa, ·</p></li>
<li><p>Art. 220.
pkt 2.
Ustawa budżetowa nie może przewidywać pokrywania deficytu budżetowego przez zaciąganie zobowiązania w centralnym banku państwa,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>które są emanacją pewnych postaw ideologicznych dominujących w okresie jej pisania i niepodparte żadną teorią ekonomiczną ani faktami.
Nie istnieją żadne prace naukowe uzasadniające próg 3/5 PKB, a przykłady wielu krajów, w tym europejskich, pokazują brak związku między przekroczeniem tego progu a wzrostem gospodarczym.
Również działania wielu banków centralnych w tym EBC, Banku Japonii, Banku Wielkiej Brytanii, FED po 2008 r.
pokazały nieracjonalność art. 220 pkt 2 konstytucji.
Na gruncie teoretycznym wyjaśnia to właśnie szkoła Nowoczesnej Teorii Monetarnej.</p>
<p>Jeśli naprawdę celem polityki gospodarczej państwa ma być pełne i produktywne zatrudnienie, to według MMT można to osiągnąć wyłącznie za pomocą polityki budżetowej.
Wynika to z dwóch faktów: po pierwsze tylko polityka budżetowa dysponuje odpowiednimi narzędziami wpływu na ogólny popyt, którego niedostateczny poziom jest główną przyczyną bezrobocia w krajach wysoko rozwiniętych; po drugie wydatki publiczne nie są ograniczone dochodami państwa.</p>
<p>Skalę wydatków publicznych ogranicza za to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Strona podażowa - w krótkim okresie w postaci zainstalowanych mocy produkcyjnych, w średnim okresie struktura zatrudnienia<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Wzrost popytu mógłby wywołać inflację gdyż płace i ceny wzrosłyby w sektorach wysoko zaawansowanych zanim zostałaby wygenerowana wystarczająca podaż miejsc pracy z sektorów opóźnionych.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>38</sup></a>, a w długim okresie wzrost wydajności pracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Strumień dochodów z tytułu odsetek od długu publicznego.</p></li>
<li><p>Wzrost zadłużenia prywatnego i wynikające z tego zagrożenie kryzysami finansowymi.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Podatki pełnią według MMT dwie funkcje: kreują popyt na państwowy pieniądz oraz poprzez ograniczanie popytu stanowią narzędzie kontroli inflacji.
Powinny zatem być powszechne i automatycznie reagować na wzrost inflacji.
Otwarte jest jednak pytanie czy automatyczna reakcja systemu podatkowego możliwa dzięki (wielu) progom podatkowym jest w stanie utrzymać inflację w ryzach?
Czy może niezbędne są działania dyskrecjonalne a jeśli tak czy są one politycznie realne?</p>
<p>Literatura nurtu MMT jest dość uboga jeśli chodzi o zdefiniowanie optymalnej struktury podatkowej.
Stwierdza się jedynie, że powinna być optymalna z punktu widzenia realizacji celów społecznych.
Kryterium powszechności najlepiej realizuje podatek od nieruchomości liczony od powierzchni, a kwestie społeczne podatek akcyzowy.
Za sprzeczne z celami społecznymi uznano podatki od wynagrodzeń, podatki konsumpcyjne oraz podatki dochodowe od osób prawnych.
Uzasadnienie ich likwidacji jest jednak pobieżne.
Biorąc więc pod uwagę polskie i europejskie uwarunkowania instytucjonalno-prawne należałoby raczej mówić nie o likwidacji takich podatków jak PIT, VAT czy CIT ale ich znacznej redukcji na korzyść podatku od nieruchomości, podatku od dochodów kapitałowych oraz podatku akcyzowego.
Głębsze zmiany w krajowym systemie podatkowym wymagałyby jednak większej harmonizacji podatków na szczeblu UE i likwidacji istniejących w tym ugrupowaniu rajów podatkowych.
Niemniej MMT stoi na stanowisku, że w sytuacji gdy podatki nie są bezpośrednio powiązane z wydatkami publicznymi to powinny być obniżone w stosunku do obecnego poziomu.</p>
